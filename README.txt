IMPORTANT
To launch the leaderboard bot, you must first replace the values 'your discord token' (run.py) with the token of your own Discord bot. Then, you need to replace the value #your guild id here with your guild ID (main.py, line 12).
For modifying the code, it is recommended to use PyCharm, but you can still use VSCode or another editor.

TO MODIFY THE MODE (normal, short, inclined), the variable "mode" is located at lines 45 and 154. I recommend visiting the mcplayhd API page for more information.
IF THE HTTP TOKEN IS INVALID (variable token, line 11), you can change the variable by entering the HTTP token, which can be obtained by visiting the support page of the mcplayhd Discord server (the token is a string variable and not an integer, so you should write the value like this: token='token' and not token=config('token')). Tokens are hidden to prevent any abuse/raids.

IF THE CODE DOES NOT WORK, YOU CAN CONTACT ME: my Discord is in my github bio, and I respond to all messages.
